with each other at the time of casting)

This spell functions like \textit{magic weapon}, except that it gives a weapon 
an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum 
+5).

Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles 
must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other 
container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when 
used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose 
of this spell.)

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} Powdered lime and carbon.
