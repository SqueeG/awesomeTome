You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can 
create the arcane eye at any point you can see, but it can then travel 
outside your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 
30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would 
(primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if 
examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as 
you would see if you were there.

The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers 
block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in 
diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a \linkspell{Gate} 
or similar magical portal.

You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, 
the eye is inert until you again concentrate.

\textit{Material Component:} A bit of bat fur.
