\spellentry{Forceful Hand}

Evocation [Force]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 6

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

This spell functions like \textit{interposing hand}, except that the \textit{forceful 
hand} pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack 
as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for 
being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always 
moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and 
it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter 
would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent 
could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.

\textit{Focus:} A sturdy glove made of leather or heavy cloth.
