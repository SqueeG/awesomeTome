You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own 
power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has -1 or fewer 
hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary 
hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level 
goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. (This increase 
in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells.) These effects 
last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.
