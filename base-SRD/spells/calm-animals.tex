This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only 
ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by 
this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 
30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal 
to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is 
allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are 
not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the 
spell on the threatened creatures.
