\spellentry{True Resurrection}

Conjuration (Healing)

\textbf{Level:} Clr 9

\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes

This spell functions like \textit{raise dead}, except that you can resurrect a 
creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell 
can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you 
unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time 
and place of birth or death is the most common method).

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit 
points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution points) or prepared 
spells.

You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned 
into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals 
or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures.

Even \textit{true resurrection} can't restore to life a creature who has died of 
old age.

\textit{Material Component:} A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total 
of at least 25,000 gp.
