This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying 
and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will 
not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general 
terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.

Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no 
save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. 

Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause 
to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion 
or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out 
of the way of those affected by the illusion.
