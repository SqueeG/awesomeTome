A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield 
this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the \textit{flame blade 
}are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per 
two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier 
does not apply to the damage. A \textit{flame blade} can ignite combustible materials 
such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

The spell does not function underwater.
