\spellentry{Warp Wood}

Transmutation

\textbf{Level:} Drd 2

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (object)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, 
and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength 
check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons 
are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A 
Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object 
as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with 
this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. 
\textit{Make whole}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive \textit{warp wood} spells to warp (or unwarp) 
an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. 

Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
