\spellentry{Zone of Silence}

Illusion (Glamer)

\textbf{Level:} Brd 4

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 round

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Area:} 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level (D)

By casting \textit{zone of silence}, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate 
vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can converse normally, yet 
no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including 
language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves 
with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, 
but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful Spot 
check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a \textit{zone of silence}.
