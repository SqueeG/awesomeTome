This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one 
of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject 
gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time 
the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), 
that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit 
points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th 
level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's 
equipment as well.

\textit{Resist energy} absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate 
side effects.

\textit{Note: Resist energy} overlaps (and does not stack with) \textit{protection 
from energy}. If a character is warded by \textit{protection from energy} and \textit{resist 
energy}, the \textit{protection} spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
