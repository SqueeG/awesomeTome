Illusion (Glamer)

\textbf{Level:} Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1, Trickery 1

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)

You make yourself -- including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment -- look different. 
You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change 
your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You 
could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor 
does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you 
or your equipment. 

If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise 
check.

A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an 
illusion.
