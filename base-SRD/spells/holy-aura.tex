A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, 
granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures 
to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance 
bonus on saves. Unlike \textit{protection from evil}, this benefit applies against 
all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and 
spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as \textit{protection 
from evil} does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, 
the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as \textit{blindness/deafness}, 
but against \textit{holy aura's} save DC).

\textit{Focus:} A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic. The reliquary costs 
at least 500 gp.
