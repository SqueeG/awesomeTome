\spellentry{Detect Good}

Divination

\textbf{Level:} Clr 1

This spell functions like \textit{detect evil}, except that it detects the auras 
of good creatures, clerics or paladins of good deities, good spells, and good magic 
items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming good aura if you are evil. Healing 
potions, antidotes, and similar beneficial items are not good.
