A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack 
to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering 
emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement 
barred by a \textit{dimensional anchor} include \textit{astral projection, blink, 
dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, 
teleport}, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The spell also prevents 
the use of a \textit{gate} or \textit{teleportation circle} for the duration of 
the spell.

A \textit{dimensional anchor} does not interfere with the movement of creatures 
already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional 
perception or attack forms. Also, \textit{dimensional anchor} does not prevent 
summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
