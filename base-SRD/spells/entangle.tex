Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures 
in the area or those that enter the area, holding them fast and causing them to 
become entangled. The creature can break free and move half its normal speed by 
using a full-round action to make a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist 
check. A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can still 
move at only half speed through the area. Each round on your turn, the plants once 
again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped entanglement.

\textit{Note:} The effects of the spell may be altered somewhat, based on the nature 
of the entangling plants.
