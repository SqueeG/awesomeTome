\spellentry{Restoration}

Conjuration (Healing)

\textbf{Level:} Clr 4, Pal 4

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

This spell functions like \textit{lesser restoration}, except that it also dispels 
negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level 
drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost 
the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has 
a level restored by r\textit{estoration has} exactly the minimum number of experience 
points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.

\textit{Restoration} cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points 
permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is 
drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target. 

\textit{Restoration} does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to 
death.

\textit{Material Component:} Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the 
target.
