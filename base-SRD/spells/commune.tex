Divination

\textbf{Level:} Clr 5

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M, DF, XP

\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

You contact your deity -- or agents thereof  -- and ask questions that can be answered 
by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically 
allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers 
given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. "Unclear" is a 
legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily 
omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to 
the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer 
instead.

The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities 
contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss 
the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

\textit{Material Component:} Holy (or unholy) water and incense.
