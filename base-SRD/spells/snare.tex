This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare 
can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast \textit{snare 
}upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a 
character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied 
in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping 
inside the circle.

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell 
causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 
1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the 
trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens 
around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.

The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist 
check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 
and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the 
spell.
