\textbf{Spell Resistance:} No

You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures 
or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can 
see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how 
to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it 
uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon 
it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.

An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder 
so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what 
you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected 
by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours.

Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact.

\textit{Focus:} A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The 
gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp.
