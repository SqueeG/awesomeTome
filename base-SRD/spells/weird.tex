Illusion (Phantasm) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 9

\textbf{Targets:} Any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 
ft. apart

This spell functions like \textit{phantasmal killer}, except it can affect more 
than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking 
them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.

If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and 
is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of temporary Strength 
damage.
