The \textit{knock} spell opens stuck, barred, locked, \textit{held}, or \textit{arcane 
locked} doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes 
or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold 
closures shut). If used to open a \textit{arcane locked} door, the spell does not 
remove the \textit{arcane lock} but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. 
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its 
own. \textit{Knock} does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as 
a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited 
by the area. Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.
