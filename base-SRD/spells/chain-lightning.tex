\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing 
from your fingertips. Unlike \linkspell{Lightning Bolt}, Chain Lightning strikes 
one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.

The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) 
to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary 
targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike 
one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down).

Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary 
targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, 
and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary 
targets than the maximum.

\textit{Focus:} A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one 
silver pin for each of your caster levels.
