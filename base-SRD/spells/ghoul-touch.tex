Necromancy

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 2

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} Living humanoid touched

\textbf{Duration:} 1d6+2 rounds

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living 
humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.

Additionally, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living 
creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude 
negates). A \textit{neutralize poison} spell removes the effect from a sickened 
creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.

\textit{Material Component:} A small scrap of cloth taken from clothing worn by 
a ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghoul's lair.
