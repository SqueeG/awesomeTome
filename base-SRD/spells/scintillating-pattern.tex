A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting 
creatures within it. The spell affects a total number of Hit Dice of creatures 
equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected 
first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's 
point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect 
a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its Hit Dice.
