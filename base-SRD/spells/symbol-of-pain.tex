\spellentry{Symbol of Pain}

Necromancy [Evil]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5

This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that each creature within 
the radius of a \textit{symbol of pain} instead suffers wracking pains that impose 
a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last 
for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of pain} has no hit point limit; 
once triggered, a \textit{symbol of pain} simply remains active for 10 minutes 
per caster level.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of pain} are hard to detect and 
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a \textit{symbol of pain 
}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 
for \textit{symbol of pain}.

\textit{Material Component:} Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and 
opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.
