\spellentry{Shapechange}

Transmutation

\textbf{Level:} Animal 9, Drd 9, Sor/Wiz 9

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)

This spell functions like \textit{polymorph}, except that it enables you to assume 
the form of any single nonunique creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. 
The assumed form cannot have more than your caster level in Hit Dice (to a maximum 
of 25 HD). Unlike \textit{polymorph}, this spell allows incorporeal or gaseous 
forms to be assumed.

You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both attacks and qualities) 
of the assumed form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain 
the type of the new form in place of your own. The new form does not disorient 
you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not 
revert to their original forms.

You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once 
each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your 
regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. If you use this 
spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.

\textit{Focus:} A jade circlet worth no less than 1,500 gp, which you must place 
on your head when casting the spell. (The focus melds into your new form when you 
change shape.)
