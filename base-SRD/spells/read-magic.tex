By means of \textit{read magic}, you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects -- books, 
scrolls, weapons, and the like -- that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering 
does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do 
so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you 
have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular 
writing without recourse to the use of \textit{read magic}. You can read at the 
rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a \textit{glyph 
of warding} with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a \textit{greater glyph of warding} with 
a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any \textit{symbol} spell with a Spellcraft check 
(DC 10 + spell level).

\textit{Read magic} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency} spell.

\textit{Focus:} A clear crystal or mineral prism.
