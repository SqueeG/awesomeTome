language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional 
dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be

to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood 
as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed 
toward the subject in any way.
