When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, \textit{status} allows 
you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are 
aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: 
unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, 
stunned, poisoned, diseased, \textit{confused}, or the like. Once the spell has 
been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not 
affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject 
leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.
