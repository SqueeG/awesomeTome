Animals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or 
supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, 
cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded 
creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any 
creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
