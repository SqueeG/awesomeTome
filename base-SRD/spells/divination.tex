Similar to \textit{augury} but more powerful, a \textit{divination} spell can provide 
you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific 
goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as 
simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. 
If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that 
the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct \textit{divination 
}is 70\% + 1\% per caster level, to a maximum of 90\%. If the dice roll fails, 
you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is 
at work.

As with \textit{augury}, multiple \textit{divinations} about the same topic by 
the same caster use the same dice result as the first \textit{divination} spell 
and yield the same answer each time.

\textit{Material Component:} Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to 
your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.
