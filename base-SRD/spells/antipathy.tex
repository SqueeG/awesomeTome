You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either 
a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, 
as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. 
A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to 
be repelled must be named.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave 
the area or to avoid the affected item.

A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly 
returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful 
saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing 
so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.
