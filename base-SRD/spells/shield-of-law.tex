A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting 
them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and \textit{slowing} chaotic 
creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance 
bonus on saves. Unlike \textit{protection from chaos}, this benefit applies against 
all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and 
spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as \textit{protection 
from chaos} does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, 
the attacker is \textit{slowed} (Will save negates, as the \textit{slow} spell, 
but against \textit{shield of law'}s save DC).

\textit{Focus:} A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap 
of parchment from a lawful text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.
