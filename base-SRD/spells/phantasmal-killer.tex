You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject 
simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that 
its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject 
can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets 
a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm 
touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from 
fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of 
damage.

If the subject of a \textit{phantasmal killer} attack succeeds in disbelieving 
and is wearing a \textit{helm of telepathy}, the beast can be turned upon you. 
You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.
