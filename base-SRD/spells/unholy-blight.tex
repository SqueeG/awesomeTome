You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, 
cloying miasma of greasy darkness.

Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good 
creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes 
it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half 
and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by \textit{remove 
disease} or \textit{heal}, but \textit{remove curse} is effective.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and 
they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down 
to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.
