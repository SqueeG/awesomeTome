The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four 
levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature 
effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. 
Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell 
resistance doesn't apply. \textit{Spell immunity} protects against spells, spell-like 
effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not 
protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons 
or gaze attacks.

Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school 
of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. 

A creature can have only one \textit{spell immunity} or \textit{greater spell immunity 
}spell in effect on it at a time.
