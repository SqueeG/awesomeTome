Shimmering, white, holy energy surrounds you. This power has three effects.

First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from 
another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The 
creature can negate the effects with a successful Will save (spell resistance applies). 
This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast 
by an evil creature or any one evil spell. \textit{Exception:} Spells that can't 
be dispelled by \textit{dispel magic} also can't be dispelled by \textit{dispel 
evil}. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use 
discharges and ends the spell.
