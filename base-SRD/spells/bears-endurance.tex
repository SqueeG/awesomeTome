The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the 
subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to 
hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth.

Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary 
hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. 
They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
