You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks extradimensional 
travel. Forms of movement barred include \textit{astral projection, blink, dimension 
door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, 
}and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. Once \textit{dimensional lock} is 
in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the area is not possible.

A \textit{dimensional lock} does not interfere with the movement of creatures already 
in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional 
perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures 
from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
