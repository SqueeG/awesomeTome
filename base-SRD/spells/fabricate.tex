You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures 
or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the \textit{fabricate} spell. 
The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material 
used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target 
is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.

You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high 
degree of craftsmanship.

Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be 
affected by the spell.

\textit{Material Component:} The original material, which costs the same amount 
as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created.
