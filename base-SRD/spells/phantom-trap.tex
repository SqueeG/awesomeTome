This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who 
can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such 
as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, 
or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100\% certain a real 
trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap 
is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste 
precious time.

If another \textit{phantom trap} is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, 
the casting fails.

\textit{Material Component:} A piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to be 
trapped while the object is sprinkled with a special dust requiring 50 gp to prepare.
