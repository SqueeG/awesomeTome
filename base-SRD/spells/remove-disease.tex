\textit{Remove disease} cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. 
The spell also kills parasites, including green slime and others. Certain special 
diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster 
of a certain level or higher.

\textit{Note:} Since the spell's duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent 
reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a later date.
