This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. 
A druid can choose the plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal 
to the plane matching his domain.

When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 
Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. 
Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they 
serve you for the duration of the spell.

The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages 
to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over 
the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, 
it is a spell of that type.
