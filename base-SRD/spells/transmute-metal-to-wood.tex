This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, 
armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic 
object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to 20 + its caster 
level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from 
metal to wood take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of 
any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this 
spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed 
by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck 
with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

Only \textit{limited wish, miracle, wish}, or similar magic can restore a transmuted 
object to its metallic state.
