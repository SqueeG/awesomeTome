You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability 
at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

\textit{Approach:} On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly 
as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, 
and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

\textit{Drop:} On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't 
pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

\textit{Fall:} On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 
1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

\textit{Flee:} On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible 
for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks 
of opportunity for this movement as normal.

\textit{Halt:} The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions 
but is not considered helpless.

If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically 
fails.
