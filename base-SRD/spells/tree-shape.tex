Transmutation

\textbf{Level:} Drd 2, Rgr 3

\textbf{Components:} V, S, DF

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level (D)

By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree 
or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection 
cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. 
To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a \textit{detect 
magic} spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you 
can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, 
and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural 
armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. 
You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried 
or worn changes with you.

You can dismiss \textit{tree shape} as a free action (instead of as a standard 
action).
