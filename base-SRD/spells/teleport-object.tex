\spellentry{Teleport Object}

Conjuration (Teleportation)

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 7

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} One touched object of up to 50 lb./level and 3 cu. ft./level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (object)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)

This spell functions like \textit{teleport}, except that it teleports an object, 
not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal 
Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly 
magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted \textit{dispel magic 
}spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
