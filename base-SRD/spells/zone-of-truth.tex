Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate 
and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid 
the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation 
area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid 
answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may 
be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures 
who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
