You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. 
You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom check. A character 
with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the Wisdom 
check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the Wisdom check.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, 
a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
