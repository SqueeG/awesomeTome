You change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where 
none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds. All affected 
creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation 
is made, you cannot change it.

You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are 
unfamiliar yourself.

A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to cast spells with 
verbal components.
