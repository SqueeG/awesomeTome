An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A \textit{slowed 
}creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but 
not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty 
on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A \textit{slowed} creature moves at half 
its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's 
jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple \textit{slow} effects don't stack. \textit{Slow} counters and dispels 
\textit{haste}.

\textit{Material Component:} A drop of molasses.
