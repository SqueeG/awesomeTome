Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural 
sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot 
detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically 
affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead 
creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any 
of the warded creatures. However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents 
are present, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts 
to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature 
(even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.
