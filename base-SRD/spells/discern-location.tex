A \textit{discern location} spell is among the most powerful means of locating 
creatures or objects. Nothing short of a \textit{mind blank} spell or the direct 
intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single 
individual or object. \textit{Discern location} circumvents normal means of protection 
from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's 
location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county 
(or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence 
where the target lies.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some 
item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least 
once.
