\spellentry{Shadow Conjuration, Greater}\label{spell:Greater Shadow Conjuration}

Illusion (Shadow)

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 7

This spell functions like \textit{shadow conjuration}, except that it can duplicate 
any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell 
of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths (60\%) 
damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60\% likely to work against 
nonbelievers.
