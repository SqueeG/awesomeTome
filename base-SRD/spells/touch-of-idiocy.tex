With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your successful melee touch 
attack applies a 1d6 penalty to the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
scores. This penalty can't reduce any of these scores below 1.

This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast some or all of 
its spells, if the requisite ability score drops below the minimum required to 
cast spells of that level.
