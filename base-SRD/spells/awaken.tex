You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a 
Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).

The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special 
empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific 
tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.

An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, 
except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
scores are each 3d6. An \textit{awakened} plant gains the ability to move its limbs, 
roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.

An awakened animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its 
type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as 
an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus 
one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

\textit{XP Cost:} 250 XP.
