The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, 
or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back.

severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

\textit{Regenerate} also cures 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum

damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including 
undead).
