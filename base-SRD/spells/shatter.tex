\textit{Shatter} creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical 
objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.

Used as an area attack, \textit{shatter} destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, 
glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point 
of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more 
than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate 
composition are shattered.

Alternatively, you can target \textit{shatter} against a single solid object, regardless 
of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline 
creature (of any weight), \textit{shatter} deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per 
caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A chip of mica.
