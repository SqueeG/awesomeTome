You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You can use the Search skill 
to detect traps just as a rogue can. In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal 
to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on Search checks made to find traps 
while the spell is in effect.

Note that \textit{find traps} grants no ability to disable the traps that you may 
find.
