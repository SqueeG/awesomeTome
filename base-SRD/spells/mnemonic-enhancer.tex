Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently 
cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.

\textit{Prepare:} You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip 
counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.

\textit{Retain:} You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up 
to 1 round before you started casting the \textit{mnemonic enhancer}. This restores 
the previously cast spell to your mind.

In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if 
not cast).

\textit{Material Component:} A piece of string, and ink consisting of squid secretion 
with black dragon's blood.

\textit{Focus:} An ivory plaque of at least 50 gp value.
