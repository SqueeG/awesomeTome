This spell functions like \textit{silent image}, except that this spell's figment 
activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, 
olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.

You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the 
spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and 
detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual 
trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the 
senses, such as alignment. (See \textit{magic mouth} for more details about such 
triggers.)

\textit{Material Component:} A bit of fleece and jade dust worth 25 gp.
