Conjuration (Healing)

\textbf{Level:} Clr 7

\textbf{Components:} V, S, XP

\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes

This spell functions like \textit{lesser restoration}, except that it dispels all 
negative levels afflicting the healed creature. This effect also reverses level 
drains by a force or creature, restoring the creature to the highest level it had 
previously attained. The drained levels are restored only if the time since the 
creature lost the level is no more than one week per caster level.

\textit{Greater restoration} also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's 
abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently 
drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and 
removes all forms of insanity, \textit{confusion}, and similar mental effects. 
\textit{Greater restoration} does not restore levels or Constitution points lost 
due to death.

\textit{XP Cost:} 500 XP.
