The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject 
gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage 
each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the 
reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster 
level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

\textit{Material Component:} Granite and 250 gp worth of diamond dust sprinkled 
on the target's skin.
