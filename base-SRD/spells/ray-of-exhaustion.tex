A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch 
attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude 
save means the creature is only fatigued.

A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal 
exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

\textit{Material Component:} A drop of sweat.
