\textit{Ironwood} is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While 
remaining natural wood in almost every way, \textit{ironwood} is as strong, heavy, 
and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function 
on \textit{ironwood}. Spells that affect wood do affect \textit{ironwood}, although 
\textit{ironwood} does not burn. Using this spell with \textit{wood shape} or a 
wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. 
Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as 
their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.

Further, if you make only half as much \textit{ironwood} as the spell would normally 
allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item 
with a +1 enhancement bonus.

\textit{Material Component:} Wood shaped into the form of the intended \textit{ironwood 
}object.
