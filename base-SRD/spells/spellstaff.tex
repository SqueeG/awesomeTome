You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden quarterstaff. Only one 
such spell can be stored in a staff at a given time, and you cannot have more than 
one \textit{spellstaff} at any given time. You can cast a spell stored within a 
staff just as though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not count 
against your normal allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material 
components required to cast the spell when you store it in the \textit{spellstaff}.

\textit{Focus:} The staff that stores the spell.
