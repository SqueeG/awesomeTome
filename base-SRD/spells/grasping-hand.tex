\spellentry{Grasping Hand}

Evocation [Force]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 7, Strength 7

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F/DF

This spell functions like \textit{interposing hand}, except the hand can also grapple 
one opponent that you select. The \textit{grasping hand} gets one grapple attack 
per round.

Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, 
Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively), 
+10 for the hand's Strength score (31), -1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is 
this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of -1. The 
hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The \textit{grasping hand} can also bull rush an opponent as \textit{forceful hand 
}does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being 
Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself 
as \textit{interposing hand} does.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

\textit{Arcane Focus:} A leather glove.
