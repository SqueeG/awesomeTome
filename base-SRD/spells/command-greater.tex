\spellentry{Command, Greater}\label{spell:Greater Command}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 5

\textbf{Targets:} One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

This spell functions like \linkspell{Command}, except that up to one creature per 
level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start 
of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another Will save 
to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
