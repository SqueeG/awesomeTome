Using the foul sight granted by the powers of unlife, you can determine the condition 
of creatures near death within the spell's range. You instantly know whether each 
creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit 
points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), undead, or 
neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).

\textit{Deathwatch} sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to 
feign death.
