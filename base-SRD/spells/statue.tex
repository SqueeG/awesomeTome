A \textit{statue} spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments 
and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The 
subject retains its own hit points.

The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. 
Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance 
of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off 
one of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage.

The subject of a \textit{statue} spell can return to its normal state, act, and 
then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if it so desires, as 
long as the spell duration is in effect.

\textit{Material Component:} Lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an iron 
bar, such as a nail or spike.
