The transmuted creature becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus 
to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and 
other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely 
on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells 
for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under 
this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill points.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.
