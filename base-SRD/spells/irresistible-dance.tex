The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with 
foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject 
to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty 
to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted 
by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity 
each round on its turn.
