The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits 
to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Sorcerers 
and bards (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell 
do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save 
DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A few feathers or a pinch of droppings from 
an eagle.
