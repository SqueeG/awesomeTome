\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate 
dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight 
can be affected by the \textit{plane shift} at the same time. Precise accuracy 
as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From 
the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles 
(5d\%) from your intended destination.

\textit{Note: Plane shift} transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. 
The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

\textit{Focus:} A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to 
which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.
