A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of 
living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of 
damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes 
a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to 
one time per level.

An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a 
successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per 
caster level.
