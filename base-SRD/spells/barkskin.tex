Barkskin toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement 
bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases 
by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at caster level 
12th.

The enhancement bonus provided by barkskin stacks with the target's natural 
armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature 
without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
