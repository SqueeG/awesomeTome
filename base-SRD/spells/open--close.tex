\spellentry{Open/Close}

Transmutation

\textbf{Level:} Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (object)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, 
barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on 
a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only 
open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar 
objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.

\textit{Focus:} A brass key.
