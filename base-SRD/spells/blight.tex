This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 
1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a Fortitude saving 
throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and 
immediately withers and dies.

This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.
