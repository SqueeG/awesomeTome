You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so 
effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see 
\textit{raise dead}). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count 
against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade 
more pleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A pinch of salt, and a copper piece for each 
eye the corpse has (or had).
