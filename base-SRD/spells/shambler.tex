The \textit{shambler} spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with 11 HD each. The 
creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or 
serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss 
them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of 
the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard 
a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside 
the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. 

The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the 
terrain is rainy, marshy, or damp.
