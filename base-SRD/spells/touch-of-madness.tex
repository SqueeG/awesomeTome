\spellentry{Touch of Madness}

Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Madness 2

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} One action

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} Creature touched

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

The caster may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. If 
the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and 
it takes no action for 1 round per caster level. The dazed subject is not stunned 
(so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, 
use mental abilities, and so on.
