This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing all unattached objects and creatures 
within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some 
solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and 
creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. 
If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, 
it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the 
spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt 
a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or 
levitate can keep themselves from falling.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A lodestone and iron filings.
