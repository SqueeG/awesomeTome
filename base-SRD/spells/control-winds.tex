You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in 
a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. 
The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose 
to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an "eye" 
of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, 
and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full 
limit.

\textit{Wind Direction:} You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function 
over the spell's area.%\item

A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.%\item

An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from 
all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.%\item

A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise 
fashion.%\item

A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area 
from one side to the other.

\textit{Wind Strength:} For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease 
wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must 
make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.

A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.

A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small 
trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.

Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even 
large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large 
trees.
