\spellentry{Sympathetic Vibration}

Evocation [Sonic]

\textbf{Level:} Brd 6

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} One freestanding structure

\textbf{Duration:} Up to 1 round/level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None; see text

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such you can create a damaging 
vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage 
per round to the target structure. (Hardness has no effect on the spell's damage.) 
You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise 
it lasts for 1 round/ level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding 
the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.

\textit{Sympathetic vibration} cannot affect creatures (including constructs). 
Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the 
effect.

\textit{Focus:} A tuning fork.
