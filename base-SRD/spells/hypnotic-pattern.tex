A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating 
creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine 
the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD 
are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to 
the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient 
to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern 
of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must 
sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

\textit{Material Component:} A glowing stick of incense or a crystal rod filled 
with phosphorescent material.
