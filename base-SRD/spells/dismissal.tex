This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails 
a special Will save (DC = spell's save DC - creature's HD + your caster level). 
If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is 
a 20\% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.
