You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short 
message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you 
if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence 
score as low as 1 can understand the \textit{sending}, though the subject's ability 
to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence score. Even if the \textit{sending 
}is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there 
is a 5\% chance that the \textit{sending} does not arrive. (Local conditions on 
other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A short piece of fine copper wire.
