This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. 
Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions 
in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack 
you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win 
an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily 
do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously 
harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth 
doing.

You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed 
twice your level.
