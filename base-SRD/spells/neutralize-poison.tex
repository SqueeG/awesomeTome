\spellentry{Neutralize Poison}

Conjuration (Healing)

\textbf{Level:} Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 3, Pal 4, Rgr 3

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M/DF

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} Creature or object of up to 1 cu. ft./level touched

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (harmless, object)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless, object)

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature 
suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, 
but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, 
temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the 
spell. Unlike with \textit{delay poison}, such effects aren't postponed until after 
the duration  -- the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied 
to it during the length of the spell.

This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object 
for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A bit of charcoal.
