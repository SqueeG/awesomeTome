A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as 
candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided 
by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical \textit{darkness} effect functions 
normally), \textit{blur}, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light 
is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable 
to light. The \textit{faerie fire} can be blue, green, or violet, according to 
your choice at the time of casting. The \textit{faerie fire} does not cause any 
harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
