A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those 
it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend 
or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, 
it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, 
though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A \textit{flaming sphere} rolls 
over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches 
and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, 
it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would 
put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding 
consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside 
unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A \textit{flaming sphere} winks 
out if it exceeds the spell's range.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and 
a dusting of powdered iron.
