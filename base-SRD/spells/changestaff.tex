You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 
24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special 
command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature 
that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys 
any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse 
with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer 
hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff 
returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is 
dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The 
staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may 
have incurred the last time it appeared.

\textit{Focus:} The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must 
be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished 
(a process requiring twenty-eight days).

You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and 
carving of the staff.
