When cast, this spell not only prevents divination spells from working to detect 
or locate the creature or object affected by \textit{sequester}, it also renders 
the affected creature or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing (as the 
\textit{invisibility} spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being 
discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected 
by \textit{sequester} become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended 
animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.

\textit{Note:} The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being 
\textit{sequestered}. There is no save to see the \textit{sequestered} creature 
or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

\textit{Material Component:} A basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram of whitewash.
