You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance 
for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. 
The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them 
resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must 
succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. 
This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check.

Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or 
with spell resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief 
saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't help.
