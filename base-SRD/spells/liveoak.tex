This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast 
on only a single tree at a time; while \textit{liveoak} is in effect, you can't 
cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 
10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet 
of something that you wish to guard or protect.

\textit{Liveoak} must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up 
to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The \textit{liveoak 
}spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. 

If \textit{liveoak} is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it 
happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location 
before taking root.
