Your speech becomes fluent and more believable. You gain a +30 bonus on Bluff checks 
made to convince another of the truth of your words. (This bonus doesn't apply 
to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion 
to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.)

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you 
to speak the truth the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check 
(1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure 
means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.
