This spell functions like \textit{mending}, except that \textit{make whole} completely 
repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as 
strong as new. The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic 
item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell 
does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, 
melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).
