\textbf{Spell Resistance:} No

Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature, 
even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the 
opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If 
the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of 
its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration 
of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This 
spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area 
or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may 
use nonattack spells or otherwise act.
