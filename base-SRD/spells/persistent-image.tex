\spellentry{Persistent Image}

Illusion (Figment)

\textbf{Level:} Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D)

This spell functions like \textit{silent image}, except that the figment includes 
visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a 
script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to 
concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish. 

\textit{Material Component:} A bit of fleece and several grains of sand.
