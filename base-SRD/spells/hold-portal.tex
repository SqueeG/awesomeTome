This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, 
or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally 
locked. A \textit{knock} spell or a successful \textit{dispel magic} spell can 
negate a \textit{hold portal} spell.

For a portal affected by this spell, add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open the 
portal.
