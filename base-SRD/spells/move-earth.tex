\textit{Move earth} moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, 
moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.

However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be 
affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet 
deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 
4 hours and 10 minutes to move.

This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates 
wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity 
until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such 
are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.

The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury 
creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain 
contours before a battle.

This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

\textit{Material Component:} A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small 
bag, and an iron blade.
