\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless); see text

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that 
cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead 
of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can 
attempt a Will save to take half damage.
