\textit{Levitate} allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up 
and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be \textit{levitated}, and 
an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally 
direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so 
is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient 
could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling 
to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

A \textit{levitating} creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds 
itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, 
the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing 
allows the creature to begin again at -1.

\textit{Focus:} Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into 
a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
