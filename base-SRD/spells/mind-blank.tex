The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or 
read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells 
and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. \textit{Mind 
blank} even foils \textit{limited wish}, \textit{miracle}, and \textit{wish} spells 
when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information 
about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as 
\textit{arcane eye}, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying 
attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
