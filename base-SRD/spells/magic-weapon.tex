\textit{Magic weapon} gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage 
rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus 
on attack rolls.)

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, 
see \textit{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus 
it can be enhanced by this spell.
