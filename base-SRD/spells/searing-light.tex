Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of light from 
your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. 
A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster 
levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster 
level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright 
light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or 
inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 
5d6).
