The \textit{lightning bolt} sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its 
path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, 
silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks 
through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; 
otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
