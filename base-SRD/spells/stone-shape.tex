You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. 
While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with \textit{stone 
shape}, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30\% chance that any shape including 
moving parts simply doesn't work.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} Soft clay, which must be worked into roughly 
the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone while the verbal 
component is uttered.
