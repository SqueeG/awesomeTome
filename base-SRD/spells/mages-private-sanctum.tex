This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only 
a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, 
can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see 
out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those 
within are immune to \textit{detect thoughts}. The ward prevents speech between 
those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent 
other communication, such as a \textit{sending} or \textit{message} spell, or telepathic 
communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the 
area.

\textit{Mage's private sanctum} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency 
}spell.

\textit{Material Component:} A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad 
of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite.
