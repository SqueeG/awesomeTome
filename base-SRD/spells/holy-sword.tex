This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee 
weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a \textit{+5 holy weapon} (+5 enhancement 
bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It 
also emits a \textit{magic circle against evil} effect (as the spell). If the \textit{magic 
circle} ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell 
is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot 
have more than one \textit{holy sword} at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any 
that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers 
of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative 
with \textit{bless weapon} or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any 
way.

This spell does not work on artifacts.

\textit{Note:} A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement 
bonus to attack.
