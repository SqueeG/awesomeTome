\subsection*{{\LARGE PSIONIC POWERS (G-P)}}

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Genesis}

Metacreativity (Creation)

\textbf{Level:} Shaper 9

\textbf{Display:} Material

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} One week (8 hours/day)

\textbf{Range:} 180 ft.; see text

\textbf{Effect:} A demiplane coterminous with the Astral Plane, centered on your 
location

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 17, XP

You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created 
by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power works best when manifested 
while you are on the Astral Plane. Manifestation of this power creates a local 
density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the 
fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum 
radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. 
Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't really stop growing, 
but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot 
increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to 
it using \textit{astral caravan}, \textit{plane shift}, or some other power or 
permanent link that you arrange for separately.

You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest \textit{genesis, 
}reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, 
water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create 
life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, 
roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in some other 
fashion if you desire. You can't create lingering psionic effects with this power; 
you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can't create a demiplane 
out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you're limited to stone and 
dirt. You can't manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is 
as the Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can 
manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and 
so on.

Antigenesis: If \textit{genesis }is manifested on the Material Plane, the power 
takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets 
no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are 
exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like 
a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot 
wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, 
leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass 
the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can 
find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die 
quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area 
alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, 
and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, 
plants, and animals.

\textit{XP Cost: }1,000 XP.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Graft Weapon}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Psychic warrior 3

\textbf{Display:} Olfactory

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 24 hours (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} 5

You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand---mundane, psionic, or magical---onto 
the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, 
and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now 
that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack and 
damage rolls while using the weapon.

The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for 
the purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon type. For instance, 
the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the purpose of delivering 
a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack. As with any 
power (or spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, 
the touch attack effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; 
on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.

For a psychic warrior under the effect of the \textit{claws of the beast }power, 
grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the 
weapon, instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior normally relies.

While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take 
a -2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily 
polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, 
at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you 
are healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently 
lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore 
your natural anatomy (by means of \textit{regenerate }or a similar effect).

When this power's duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and 
your hand returns.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Grease, Psionic}

Metacreativity (Creation)

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 1

\textbf{Display:} Visual and olfactory

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) 

\textbf{Target or Area:} One object or a 10-ft. square

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} See spell text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

As the \textit{grease }spell, except as noted here.

Sometimes this power is referred to as \textit{ectoplasmic sheen.}

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Grip of Iron}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Psychic warrior 1

\textbf{Display:} Visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 immediate action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action, gaining a +4 
enhancement bonus on your grapple checks.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the 
benefit of the power in the current round. Manifesting this power is an immediate 
action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit 
of one quickened power per round. You can manifest this power when it isn't your 
turn (if you are grappled).

\textbf{Augment:} For every 4 additional power points you spend, the enhancement 
bonus on your grapple checks increases by 2.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Hail of Crystals}

Metacreativity (Creation)

\textbf{Level:} Shaper 5

\textbf{Display:} Auditory and visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)

\textbf{Area:} 20-ft.-radius burst

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Reflex half

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 9

A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and rapidly expands 
to a 2-foot-diameter ball of crystal as it speeds toward the location you designate. 
You can choose to aim this crystal at a single target or at a specific point in 
space (a grid intersection).

If you aim the crystal at a single target, you must make a ranged touch attack 
to strike the target. Any creature or object struck by the ball of crystal takes 
5d4 points of bludgeoning damage.

Whether the crystal hits its target, misses, or was aimed at a point in space, 
it explodes upon arrival at the location you designated. Anyone within 20 feet 
of the explosion takes 9d4 points of slashing damage from the thousands of crystal 
shards that spray forth.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage 
from the explosion of the crystal increases by 1d4 points.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Hammer}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1

\textbf{Display:} Auditory and material

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

This power charges your touch with the force of a sledgehammer. A successful melee 
touch attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. This damage is not increased 
or decreased by your Strength modifier.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration 
increases by 1 round.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Hustle}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Egoist 3, psychic warrior 2

\textbf{Display:} Auditory

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 swift action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Effect:} 1 extra move action

\textbf{Power Points:} Egoist 5, psychic warrior 3

You gain an additional move action in the current round. Taking a full round's 
worth of attacks and then using this power to move away from your foe does provoke 
attacks of opportunity.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the 
benefit of the power before you move. Manifesting the power is a swift action, 
like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one 
quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn't your turn.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Hypercognition}

Clairsentience

\textbf{Level:} Seer 8

\textbf{Display:} Mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action or 1 immediate action; see text

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Power Points:} 15

You make lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue, pattern, or 
scrap of memory resident in your mind. You can make reasonable statements about 
a person, place, or object, seemingly from very little knowledge. However, your 
knowledge is in fact the result of a rigorously logical process that you force 
your mind to undertake, digging up and correlating every possible piece of knowledge 
bearing on the topic (possibly even extracting echoes of knowledge from the Astral 
Plane).

The nature of the knowledge you gain concerning the subject of your analysis might 
include the answer to a riddle, the way out of a maze, stray bits of information 
about a person, legends about a place or an object, or even a conclusion concerning 
a dilemma that your conscious mind is unable to arrive at.

An Intelligence check may be required to obtain the desired information. If so, 
you can manifest \textit{hypercognition }as an immediate action prior to making 
the check and receive a +20 bonus for doing so.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Id Insinuation}

Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration + 1 round

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 3

As the \textit{confusion }spell, except as noted here.

Swift tendrils of thought disrupt the unconscious mind of any one creature, sapping 
its might. As long as the manifester remains concentrating fully on this power, 
the subject is \textit{confused}, making it unable to independently determine it 
will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each of the subject's 
turns to see what the subject does in that round.

\end{longtable}

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save 
DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target. Any additional 
target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Identify, Psionic}

Clairsentience

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 2

\textbf{Display:} Material and mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} One day

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} One touched object

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 3

As the \textit{identify }spell, except as noted here. 

This power is used to identify the abilities of psionic items.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Immovability}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Psychic warrior 4

\textbf{Display:} Visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead, you mentally 
attach yourself to the underlying fabric of the plane. Thus, you could conceivably 
anchor yourself in midair. Any creature attempting to physically move you must 
succeed on an opposed Strength check, and you gain a +20 bonus on the check. You 
can't voluntarily move to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends 
the power.

You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your anchored body 
gains damage reduction 15/-.

You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale movements (you 
can make smallscale movements, such as breathing, turning your head, moving your 
eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the teleportation descriptor, or any telekinetic 
effect, manifested on you automatically fail.

\textbf{Augment:} If you spend 8 additional power points, you can manifest this 
power as an immediate action.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Incarnate}

Metacreativity

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 5

\textbf{Display:} Material

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 2 rounds

\textbf{Range:} See text

\textbf{Target, Effect, or Area:} See text

\textbf{Duration:} Permanent; see text

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 9, XP

This power makes certain other powers permanent. Depending on the power to be affected, 
you must be of a minimum manifester level and must expend a number of XP.

You can make the following powers permanent only in regard to yourself.

\section*{Inertial Armor}

Psychokinesis

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1

\textbf{Display:} Visual; see text

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} 1; see text

Your mind generates a tangible field of force that provides a +4 armor bonus to 
Armor Class. Unlike mundane armor, \textit{inertial armor }entails no armor check 
penalty or speed reduction. Because \textit{inertial armor }is composed of psychokinetic 
force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

Your \textit{inertial armor }can be invisible or can appear as a colored glow, 
at your option.

The armor bonus provided by \textit{inertial armor }does not stack with the armor 
bonus provided by regular armor.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, the armor bonus 
to Armor Class increases by 1.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{Inertial Barrier}

Psychokinesis

\textbf{Level:} Kineticist 4, psychic warrior 4

\textbf{Display:} Auditory and mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You create a skin-tight psychokinetic barrier around yourself that resists blows, 
cuts, stabs, and slashes, as well as providing some protection against falling. 
You gain damage reduction 5/-. \textit{Inertial barrier }also absorbs half the 
damage you take from any fall.

\section*{Inflict Pain}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 2

\textbf{Display:} Mental

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial; see text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 3

You telepathically stab the mind of your foe, causing horrible agony. The subject 
suffers wracking pain that imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, 
and ability checks. If the target makes its save, it takes only a -2 penalty.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save 
DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target. Any additional 
target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save 
DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target. Any additional 
target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.

\textbf{Area:} 20-ft.-radius spread centered on you

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You encase yourself and your allies in a shimmering fortress of telekinetic force. 
All damage from powers and psi-like abilities taken by subjects inside the area 
of the \textit{intellect fortress, }including ability damage, is halved. This lowering 
takes place prior to the effects of other powers or abilities that lessen damage, 
such as damage reduction and evasion.

Powers that are not subject to power resistance are not affected by an \textit{intellect 
fortress.}

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an 
emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened 
power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. 
You can use this power even when it's not your turn.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration 
increases by 1 round.

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters who end up 
at unfamiliar destinations after teleporting, using a \textit{gate, }or traveling 
to or from other planes of existence. The power reveals general information about 
your location as a feeling or presentiment. The information is usually no more 
detailed than a summary that locates you according to a prominent local or regional 
site. Using this power also tells you what direction you are facing.

Using this power prior to making a Knowledge (the planes) check with \textit{astral 
caravan }grants a +2 bonus on the check.

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min.

\textbf{Power Points:} 9

You raise a field of potentiality that drains the vitality from powers that you 
successfully save against. When you succeed on a saving throw to negate the effect 
of a foe's power on you, and the power is one that \textit{leech field }is effective 
against (see below), your body erupts in a brief flash of crackling dark energy. 
You gain 1 power point for every 2 power points your foe spent to manifest the 
power you just saved against (to a maximum number of points equal to your manifester 
level). You cannot gain power points that would cause you to exceed your normal 
daily maximum.

This power is effective against any power that targets a single creature and allows 
the target a saving throw to negate it, except those that are delivered by a touch 
attack or a ranged touch attack (including a ray).

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's duration

\textbf{Area:} 1 cu. ft./level of inanimate material

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 15, XP

You can weaken or strengthen the substance of an object or structure. You can affect 
both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object's substance decreases 
its hardness and hit points, and strengthening it increases its hardness and hit 
points. You can increase or decrease an object's hardness by up to 5 from its original 
hardness. When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 
hit points per inch of thickness for every point of increased hardness. When hardness 
decreases, the object (or portion of an object) loses 2 hit points per inch of 
thickness for every point of decreased hardness (to a minimum of 1 hit point per 
inch of thickness).

You can't decrease the hardness of an object that already has hardness 0.

\textit{Working Manipulated Metals: }An object or portion thereof whose hardness 
is decreased or increased is permanently changed. Even hardening adamantine to 
25 is possible. You can also harden or weaken a preforged weapon, a suit of armor, 
or some other finished item.

\textit{XP Cost: }250 XP for each point by which the object's hardness is altered.

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round

\textbf{Power Points:} 5

You project a field of improbability around yourself, creating a fleeting protective 
shell. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class.

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an 
emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened 
power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. 
You can use this power even when it's not your turn; however, you must manifest 
it prior to an opponent's attack roll in order to gain this power's benefit against 
that attack.

\textbf{Augment:} You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. If you spend 4 additional power points, the deflection bonus to Armor Class 
increases by 1.

2. For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases

\section*{Metaconcert}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Psychic warrior 5, telepath 5

\textbf{Display:} Visual; see text

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 minute

\textbf{Range:} 20 ft.

\textbf{Target:} You and up to nine other willing psionic creatures in range

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} 9

You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating an entity more 
powerful than the sum of its parts.

When you manifest this power, a number of power points you designate flows from 
each participant into a collective pool. One individual is chosen as the \textit{metaconcert 
}conductor by mutual consent of the other participants (this is usually the manifester, 
but doesn't have to be). Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts 
of the group. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants 
in a complex and shifting pattern.

All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity ccreated with 
\textit{metaconcert }(which is under the conductor's command). This entity can't 
take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all its powers 
more effectively. Each participant contributing to the entity provides a cumulative 
+1 bonus to save DCs that apply when manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. 
Likewise, each individual provides a cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes 
its own saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities.

If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attack\textit{ }the total 
is divided among all the members as determined by the conductor.

If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the participants pay an 
equal share (the conductor pays the remainder if the cost can't be divided evenly).

Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area, and as 
a group can move at a speed of 10 feet. If a participant moves outside the 20-foot-radius 
area occupied by the others (whether willingly or involuntarily), that individual 
drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the \textit{metaconcert }is 
instantly recalculated.

All participants who leave before a \textit{metaconcert }ends or is dismissed reclaim 
a number of power points equal to the current power point pool divided by the number 
of members. If the conductor drops out, the power ends. That same number of points 
is removed from the power point pool.

When a \textit{metaconcert }ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power points 
in the pool are divided among all the participants (the conductor receives the 
remainder if the points can't be divided evenly).

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration 
increases by 1 minute.

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 hour

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous and 1 min./level (D); see text

\textbf{Power Points:} 17, XP

You elevate your mind to a near-universal consciousness, cogitating countless impressions 
and predictions involving any creature you have seen before, whether personally 
or by means of another power such as \textit{remote viewing}.

This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision of the creature's nature, activities, 
and whereabouts. When you manifest the power, you learn the following facts about 
the creature.•

Its name, race, alignment, and character class.•

A general estimate of its level or Hit Dice: low (5 HD or lower), medium (6 to 
11 HD), high (12 to 20 HD), very high (21 HD to 40 HD), or deific (41 HD or higher).•

Its location (including place of residence, town, country, world, and plane of 
existence).•

Significant items currently in its possession.•

Any significant activities or actions the creature has undertaken in the previous 
8 hours, including details such as locales traveled through, the names or races 
of those the creature fought, spells it cast, items it acquired, and items it left 
behind (including the location of those items).•

A current mental view of the creature, as described in the \textit{remote viewing 
}power, which you can maintain for up to 1 minute per level.

\textit{Metafaculty }can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as \textit{screen 
}or \textit{mind blank }(or even a \textit{wish }spell) that normally obscure clairsentience 
powers. You can attempt a caster level check (DC 6 + caster level of the creator 
of the obscuring effect) to defeat these sorts of otherwise impervious defenses.

\textit{Metafaculty }is defeated by epic powers, epic spells, and epic special 
abilities that obscure divinations and clairsentience powers.

\textit{XP Cost: }1,000.

\section*{Metamorphosis}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Egoist 4

\textbf{Display:} Material and olfactory

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D) for a creature; 1 hour/level (D) for an object

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any 
other type except construct, elemental, outsider, and undead. The assumed form 
can have as many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to a maximum of 15.

You can't assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an incorporeal, ectoplasmic, 
or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. 
Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match the new form.

Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though 
this healing does not restore ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; 
and changing back does not heal you further). If you are slain while under the 
effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. 
You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain 
your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all extraordinary 
special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) 
but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such 
as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural, psionic, 
or spelllike abilities.

You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities 
of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does 
not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks and special qualities 
derived from class levels, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your 
normal form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise 
not retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. 
You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.

You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. 
Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as 
burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed 
of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, 
natural weapons (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial 
bonus feats, and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number 
of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make 
more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.

You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair 
color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of 
that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, 
and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for 
the new form's species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the 
new form's race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus 
on your Disguise check.

When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form 
(if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in question) or melds into the 
new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal form, any objects 
previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body 
they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore 
in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your 
feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to 
both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held 
in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from 
the whole reverts to its normal form.

You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain 
the object's hardness and retain your own hit points. You can take the shape of 
almost any simple object you can think of. If you attempt to take the form of a 
complex object, you must make an appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, 
your manifestation of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the 
form of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated 
with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item 
or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot 
take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.

As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and 
your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a Concentration check 
(DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the duration of this power. If you 
take damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage 
(but the object's hardness, if any, protects you).

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D) for a creature; 1 hour/level (D) for an object

\textbf{Power Points:} 17, XP

As \textit{metamorphosis}, except that this power enables you to assume the form 
of any single nonunique object or creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal 
size. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than twice your manifester level 
(to a maximum of 50 HD). Unlike \textit{metamorphosis}, this power allows incorporeal, 
ectoplasmic, or gaseous forms to be assumed.

You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both special attacks and 
special qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. 
You also gain the type of the new form (for example, dragon or magical beast) in 
place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces 
of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original form.

You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once 
each round as a swift action.

The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately 
after it, but not during the action.

If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise 
check.

As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility; however, you retain your ability 
to manifest powers normally.

If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect 
such as \textit{claws of the beast}) or a bite attack (which could be a natural 
bite attack or one you gain by means of the power \textit{bite of the wolf }), 
you can use this power to provide one of your natural weapons a +1 enhancement 
bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

\textbf{Augment:} If you spend 4 additional power points, this power's duration

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes (harmless, object)

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

\textit{Metaphysical weapon }gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls 
and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's 
+1 bonus on attack rolls.)

Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles 
must be of the same type, and they have to be together (such as in the same quiver). 
Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their enhancement when used. (Treat shuriken 
as projectiles, rather than thrown weapons, for the purpose of this power.)

You can't manifest this power on most natural weapons, including a psychic warrior's 
claw strike. This power does work on a weapon brought into being by the \textit{graft 
weapon }power.

\textbf{Augment:} If you spend 4 additional power points, this power's duration 
increases to 1 hour per level.

In addition, for every 4 additional power points you spend, this power improves 
the weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls by 1.

\section*{Microcosm}

Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 9

\textbf{Display:} Material

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target or Area:} One creature; or one or more creatures within a 15-ft.-radius 
sphere

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 17

This power enables you to warp the consciousness and senses of one or more creatures, 
sending the victim into a catatonic state. When \textit{microcosm }is manifested, 
you can target either a single creature within range or a group of creatures all 
located within the power's area.

\textit{Single Target: }If \textit{microcosm }targets a single creature, that creature's 
senses are pinched off from the real world if it currently has 100 or fewer hit 
points. The subject's senses are all completely fabricated from within its own 
mind, though it may not realize this. In reality, the subject sprawls limply, drooling 
and mewling, and eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject 
lives within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.

\textit{Area Effect: }If \textit{microcosm }is manifested on an area, it sends 
all affected creatures into a shared catatonia (the world is a construct, but within 
the world, the victims can interact with each other). It affects only creatures 
that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points 
of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals 
first. (Creatures with negative hit points count as having 0 hit points.)

Manifesting \textit{microcosm }a second time on an affected creature turns its 
sensory pathways outward once more. Otherwise, only very potent powers (such as 
\textit{psychic chirurgery }or \textit{reality revision}) or similar effects (such 
as \textit{miracle }or \textit{wish}) can undo the mental crosswiring that this 
power brings about.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, the number of individual 
and group hit points the power can affect increases by 10.

The subject is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that detect, influence,

or scrying descriptors. \textit{Psionic mind blank }even foils \textit{bend reality, 
limited wish, miracle, reality revision, }and \textit{wish }when they are used 
in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it (however, 
\textit{metafaculty }can pierce the protective quality of \textit{psionic mind 
blank}). In the case of \textit{remote viewing }or scrying that scans an area the 
creature is in, the effect works but the creature simply isn't detected. \textit{Remote

work at all.

succeeds on a Will save, it is not required to answer the question; however, making 
a save does not end the power. You can ask the subject a new question (or the same 
question) in subsequent rounds for as long as the power's duration persists.

You can probe a sleeping subject and automatically get an answer to your question. 
If the subject then succeeds on a Will save, it wakes after providing the answer 
and thereafter can resist answering by making Will saves as described above.

Subjects that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power's range, 
unless they are somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the 
answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the subject 
do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield 
up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.

\section*{Mind Seed}

Telepathy (Compulsion) [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Telepath 8

\textbf{Display:} Mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} One touched Medium or smaller humanoid

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous; see text

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 15, XP

You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject's subconscious. If successfully 
implanted, the seed of your mind ``germinates'' over the period of one week. During 
this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on your mannerisms. 

When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you in mind 
as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject's level is eight lower 
than your own. (In effect, the subject has received eight negative levels---but 
these are negative levels that can't be removed.) The subject does not have any 
of your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also 
knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.

While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge 
over time. Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it 
possesses its original ``soul'' and physical body and is free to develop its own 
personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave 
or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your 
earlier memories.

\textit{Protection from evil }or a similar spell or power can prevent you from 
implanting \textit{mind seed, }or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective 
power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination) 
only by \textit{psychic chirurgery, reality revision}, or similarly high-level 
effects. Manifesting \textit{mind seed }again during the germination period also 
cleanses the subject's mind.

\textit{XP Cost: }3,000 XP.

\section*{Mind Switch}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Telepath 6

\textbf{Display:} Visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 round

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Targets:} You and one other creature

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 11, XP

You can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing your mind 
(and soul) into its body, and its mind into your body. You can target any creature 
whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than your manifester level.

You possess the target's body and force the creature's mind into your body unless 
it succeeds on a Will save. You can move your mind back into your own body whenever 
you desire, which returns the subject's mind to its own body and ends the power. 
If the manifestation succeeds, your life force occupies the host body, and the 
host's life force takes over yours.

You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but 
not upon its acquired or learned knowledge (such as skills and feats it possesses). 
The same is true for the subject in your body. The \textit{mind switch }brings 
about the following changes.•

You gain the type of your assumed body.•

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of your assumed body.•

You gain the natural armor, natural attacks, movement, and other simple physical 
characteristics of your assumed body.•

You gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of your assumed body, 
but you do not gain supernatural or spell-like abilities.•

You gain the possessions and equipment of your assumed body.•

You retain your own hit points, saving throws (possibly modified by new ability 
scores), class abilities, supernatural and spell-like abilities, spells and powers, 
and skills and feats (although skill checks use your new ability scores, and you 
may be temporarily unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your 
new body).

Supernatural abilities that require a certain body part may be unavailable in your 
new form.

If either body is killed while the power is in effect, the other participant also 
dies when the power ends. If one participant's body becomes petrified, imprisoned 
by \textit{temporal stasis }or \textit{imprisonment, }or incapacitated in some 
other way, the other participant will be incapacitated in that way when the power 
ends.

A targeted \textit{dispel psionics }(or similar spells or effects) successfully 
manifested on either participant causes both minds to return to their original 
bodies.

\textit{XP Cost: }100 XP.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save 
DC increases by 1.

\section*{Mind Switch, True}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Telepath 9

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 minute

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 17, XP

As \textit{mind switch, }except as noted here. You permanently exchange bodies 
with the subject. Since this power's duration is instantaneous, you cannot be forced 
to return to your natural body by means of \textit{dispel psionics, }an \textit{antimagic 
field, }or a similar effect. If the subject's body dies while you are in it, you 
are dead. The subject immediately loses one level, but otherwise survives the experience 
in your natural body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you 
immediately lose one level, but you likewise survive the experience in your new 
body.

Your ``natural'' body is always considered to be the last one you switched out 
of. If you exchange bodies with a chain of multiple subjects, you need worry only 
about the welfare of the last body you switched with. In other words, if your mind 
is expelled from your current body, your mind returns to the last body you switched 
with, not to your original body. Similarly, if your original body dies but you 
have since switched minds with a second subject, you take no penalty. You lose 
a level only if the body you inhabited immediately prior to your current body is 
killed.

\textit{XP Cost: }10,000 XP.

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes (harmless)

\textbf{Power Points:} 5

You set up a trap in your mind against psionic intruders. Anyone who attacks you 
with a telepathy power immediately loses 1d6 power points. This power's effect 
does not negate the power that is currently being used against you. You can manifest 
this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefit in an emergency. Manifesting 
the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts 
toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can use this power 
even when it is not your turn.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration 
increases by 1 round.

score of 3 or higher

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None; see text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes (harmless)

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

You forge a telepathic bond with your target. You can communicate telepathically 
through the bond even if you do not share a common language. No special power or 
influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works 
over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

\textbf{Augment:} You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can attempt to create a telepathic 
bond with a creature that is not willing (Will save negates).

2. For every additional power point you spend, this power can affect an additional 
target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of 
the power.

\textbf{Level:} Telepath 4

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

As \textit{mindlink}, except that if the target is a psionic character or creature 
that knows powers, you can temporarily borrow a power of your choice (you are aware 
of what powers the subject knows, up to the highest level of power you can manifest).

Borrowing the subject's power is a separate standard action that provokes an attack 
of opportunity. If that attack succeeds, the mental communication provided by this 
power ends immediately. The borrowed power fades from the subject's awareness and 
appears within your own. You can now spend power points to manifest the borrowed 
power just as if it were one of your powers known. You maintain knowledge of the 
borrowed power until the duration of your \textit{thieving mindlink }expires, at 
which time you lose knowledge of the power and the power reappears in the mind 
of the subject, no matter how far from you the subject is. Even if the subject 
is slain, you lose knowledge of the borrowed power when this power's duration expires.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save 
DC increases by 1.

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You partially wipe your victim's mind of past experiences, bestowing two negative 
levels upon it. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, 
it dies. For each negative level it gains, a psionic creature loses knowledge of 
one power from its highest available level, and a number of power points from its 
maximum power point total sufficient to manifest that power. The effects of multiple 
negative levels stack.

If the subject survives, it loses these two negative levels after 1 hour. (No Fortitude 
save is necessary to avoid gaining the negative level permanently.)

\textbf{Augment:} You can manifest this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save DC increases 
by 1.

2. For every 3 additional power points you spend, this power bestows an additional 
negative level on the subject.

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

Your eyes beam forth a 20-foot cone of light. You and other creatures can see normally 
in the light. If you walk into an area filled with psionic or magical darkness, 
\textit{my light }goes dark while you stay within that area.

If \textit{my light }is used in conjunction with \textit{elfsight}, the cone of 
light extends out to 40 feet instead of 20 feet.

\textbf{Augment:} If you spend 2 additional power points, you can manifest this 
power as a swift action.

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} See text

\textbf{Power Points:} 11

An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier 
is impervious to most psionic effects, including powers, psi-like abilities, and 
supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any psionic items 
or powers within its confines. A \textit{null psionics field }suppresses any power 
or psionic effect used within, brought into, or manifested into its area, but does 
not negate it. Time spent within a \textit{null psionics field }counts against 
a suppressed effect's duration.

Astral constructs and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a \textit{null 
psionics field}. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time 
spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the power that is maintaining 
the construct or summoned creature.

Creation powers with instantaneous durations and calling powers are not affected 
by a \textit{null psionics field }because the power itself is no longer in effect, 
only its result.

A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a created one, 
for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a 
psionic sword does not function psionically within the area, it is still a sword 
(and a masterwork sword at that). The power has no effect on golems and other constructs 
that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting 
(unless they have been summoned or have a limited duration, in which case they 
are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and 
outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like 
or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.

\textit{Dispel psionics }does not remove the field. Two or more \textit{null psionics 
fields }sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain powers 
may be unaffected by \textit{null psionics field }(see the individual power descriptions). 
Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this. Should a creature's 
space extend across the boundary of the area enclosed by the field, any part of 
the creature that lies outside the effect is unaffected by the field.

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} Psion/wilder 13, psychic warrior 9

This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you several advantages.

You gain damage reduction 10/ slashing and a +5 bonus to natural armor that overlaps 
(does not stack with) any natural armor bonus you may already have. You are immune 
to ability damage, blindness, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and 
all powers, spells, or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because 
you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.

You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you become susceptible 
to all special attacks that affect wood, and you gain vulnerability to fire.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a -2 penalty to Dexterity 
(to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. 
You can speak but cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. 
You have an armor check penalty of -4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25\%.

Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters, 
1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. 
When you make a full attack against an object or structure using your unarmed strike, 
you deal double damage.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration 
increases by 1 minute.

\section*{Object Reading}

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} Object touched

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 3

You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects accumulate 
psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be read by use of 
this power. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a 
particular object.

\textit{1st Minute: }Last owner's race.

\textit{2nd Minute: }Last owner's gender.

\textit{3rd Minute: }Last owner's age.

\textit{4th Minute: }Last owner's alignment.

\textit{5th Minute: }How last owner gained and lost the object.

\textit{6th+ Minute: }Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.

The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and the original 
owner (if you keep the power active long enough).

There is a 90\% chance that this power will successfully identify all other former 
owners in sequence, but there is a 10\% chance that one former owner will be skipped 
and thus not identified.

This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object 
to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a casual user.)

An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can continue 
to run through a list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as 
the power's duration lasts. If you use this power additional times on the same 
object, the information yielded is the same as if you were using the power on the 
object for the first time.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's maximum 
duration increases by 10 minutes.

\section*{Personality Parasite}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 4

\textbf{Target:} One Medium or smaller humanoid

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a minor personality 
that is antagonistic to the main personality. The parasitic personality functions 
with complete autonomy from the main personality. It does not control the body 
physically, but it can take one standard action each round that is purely mental, 
such as manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal 
actions.

The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject's power point reserve 
and known powers, but can only manifest powers three or more levels lower than 
the highest level of power the subject can normally manifest. 

The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that negatively 
impact the subject, using the highest-level powers possible (so as to deplete the 
subject's power point reserve), and the most deadly to the subject. You do not 
have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always works against 
the interest of the subject.

Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is targeted 
by a compulsion or charm effect while under the effect of this power, it can make 
a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both saving throws fail, then 
this power ends and the creature is affected by the charm or compulsion effect.

The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main personality 
is subjected to a \textit{haste }or \textit{schism }effect.

Your brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with your foe, 
draining it of 1d6 power points and adding 1 of those points to your reserve (unless 
that gain would cause you to exceed your maximum). 

The drain continues in each round you maintain concentration while the subject 
of the drain remains in range. If the subject is drained to 0 power points, this 
power ends.

Concentrating to maintain \textit{power leech }is a full-round action (you can 
take no other actions aside from a 5-foot step) instead of a standard action.

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

\textit{Precognition }allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future 
events---what you see will probably happen if no one takes action to change it. 
However, your vision is incomplete, and it makes no real sense until the actual 
events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That's when everything begins to come together, 
and you can act, if you act swiftly, on the information you previously received 
when you manifested this power. 

In practice, manifesting this power grants you a ``precognitive edge.'' Normally, 
you can have only a single precognitive edge at one time. You must use your edge 
within a period of no more than 10 minutes per level, at which time your preknowledge 
fades and you lose your edge.

You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially, the edge 
translates into a +2 insight bonus that you can apply at any time to either an 
attack roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, or a skill check. You can elect to 
apply the bonus to the roll after you determine that your unmodified roll is lower 
than desired.

\textbf{Power Points:} 1

If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect 
such as \textit{claws of the beast}), you can use this power to produce a mild 
venom that coats one of your claws. On your next successful melee attack, the venom 
deals 2 points of Constitution damage. A target struck by the poison can make a 
Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your manifester level + your key ability modifier) 
to negate the damage.

If an enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can make the attack 
even if you've already taken your allotted number of attacks of opportunity this 
round (usually one).

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain an extra attack of 
opportunity in the same round. Manifesting this power is an immediate action, like 
manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened 
power per round.

You gain the powerful charging ability of a lion. When you charge, you can make 
a full attack in the same round.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the 
benefit of the power as you charge. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like 
manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened 
power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn't your turn.

\textbf{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, each of your attacks 
after a charge in the current round gains a circumstance bonus on damage equal

A \textit{psionic lock }manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically locks 
it. You can freely pass your own lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or 
object secured with \textit{psionic lock }can be opened only by breaking in or 
by a successful \textit{dispel psionics }effect. Add +10 to the normal DC to break 
open a door or portal affected by this power.

of damage +1 point per manifester level. Constructs that are immune to psionics 
or magic cannot be repaired in this fashion.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power repairs 
an additional 1d8 points of damage.

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes (harmless)

\textbf{Power Points:} 9, XP

\textit{Psionic revivify }lets a manifester reconnect a corpse's psyche with its 
body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The power must be manifested 
within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the psyche of the deceased has completely 
left the body, this power halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage 
to the body.

This power functions like the \textit{raisedead }spell, except that the affected 
creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of powers. 

The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to life.

\textit{XP Cost: }200 XP.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 100 additional experience points that both you and 
the subject pay, the manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1 additional 
round.

\section*{Psionic Scent}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Psychic warrior 2

\textbf{Display:} Mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Power Points:} 3

You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. 
This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and 
track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar odors 
just as humanoids do familiar sights\textit{.}

You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, 
the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, 
such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. 
Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at 
triple normal range.

When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed---only 
its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction 
of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's 
location.

If you have the Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or 
Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 
10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases 
depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the 
age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. 
The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. If you are tracking 
with \textit{psionic scent, }you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor 
visibility.

\section*{Psychic Chirurgery}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Telepath 9

\textbf{Display:} Auditory, mental, and visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 10 minutes

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 17, XP; see text

You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of powers you 
know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.

\textit{Repair Psychic Damage: }You can remove any compulsions and charms affecting 
the subject. In fact, you can remove any instantaneous or permanent effect caused 
by a psychic power with \textit{psychic chirurgery}. Unlike with \textit{aura alteration}, 
these effects end or are negated as soon as this power is manifested, with no need 
for another saving throw.

You can remove all negative levels affecting the subject, regardless of how it 
lost those levels, restoring it to the highest level it had previously attained. 
Also, you can restore levels lost to energy drain or a similar effect if the level 
drain occurred within a number of hours equal to your manifester level.

You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject's ability scores, 
heal all ability damage, and remove any ability drain affecting the subject. \textit{Psychic 
chirurger}y negates all forms of insanity, confusion, the effect of such powers 
as \textit{microcosm, }and so on, but it does not restore levels or Constitution 
points lost due to death.

\textit{Transfer Knowledge: }If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer 
knowledge of a power you know to another psionic character. You can give a character 
knowledge of a power of any level that she can manifest, even if the power is not 
normally on the character's power list. Knowledge of powers gained through \textit{psychic 
chirurgery }does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character can 
know per level.

\textit{XP Cost: }Each time you use psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of 
a power in another creature, you pay an XP cost equal to 1,000 x the level of the 
power implanted. If you and the subject are both willing to do so, you can split 
this cost evenly.

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial; see text

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 9

Your will abruptly and brutally crushes the mental essence of any one creature, 
debilitating its acumen. The target must make a Will save with a +4 bonus or collapse 
unconscious and dying at -1 hit points. If the target succeeds on the save, it 
takes 3d6 points of damage.

\textbf{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's damage 
increases by 1d6 points.

\section*{Psychic Reformation}

Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Psion/wilder 4

\textbf{Display:} Auditory, mental, and visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 10 minutes

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Power Resistance:} No

\textbf{Power Points:} 7, XP; see text

When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most recently 
gained skill points differently (picking new skills and abandoning old ones if 
it chooses) and to choose a different feat from the one it selected when advancing 
from its previous level to its current level.

The subject can also choose to forget powers it acquired when advancing to its 
current level, replacing them with new ones.

The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower levels, if 
both the subject and the manifester agree to pay the necessary XP before this power 
is manifested (see below). The subject must abide by the standard rules for selecting 
skills and feats, and so it cannot take feats for which it doesn't qualify or take 
crossclass skills as class skills.

\textit{XP Cost: }This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made when 
the character reached her current level. For each additional previous level into 
which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional 50 XP. The manifester 
and subject split all XP costs evenly.

\section*{Psychic Vampire}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Egoist 4, psychic warrior 4

\textbf{Display:} Mental

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Touch

\textbf{Target:} Creature touched

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates

\textbf{Power Resistance:} Yes

\textbf{Power Points:} 7

This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with darkness that 
you can use to drain an opponent's power.

If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful melee touch 
attack you make (if the victim fails its Fortitude save) drains 2 power points 
from your foe for every manifester level you have. The drained points simply dissipate. 
Your touch attack, charged with psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.

If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you must make 
a successful melee attack with the weapon to gain the power's benefit.

Against a psionic being that has no power points or a nonpsionic foe, your attack 
instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (your choice).

\section*{Psychofeedback}

Psychometabolism

\textbf{Level:} Egoist 5, psychic warrior 5

\textbf{Display:} Visual

\textbf{Manifesting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)

\textbf{Power Points:} 9

You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the expense of 
one or more other scores. Select one ability score you would like to boost, and 
increase it by the same amount that you decrease one or more other scores. All 
score decreases are treated as a special form of ability damage, called ability 
burn, which cannot be magically or psionically healed---it goes away only through 
natural healing.

You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score by an amount equal 
to your manifester level (or any lesser amount), assuming you can afford to burn 
your other ability scores to such an extent.

When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost also ends, but your 
ability burn remains until it is healed naturally.
