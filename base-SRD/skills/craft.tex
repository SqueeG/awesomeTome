Like \linkskill{Knowledge}, \linkskill{Perform}, and \linkskill{Profession}, Craft is actually a number of separate 
skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased 
as a separate skill.

A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created 
by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a \linkskill{Profession} skill.

\textbf{Check:} You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about 
half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how 
to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to 
supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers 
and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)

The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item 
of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. 
The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes 
to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of 
raw materials.

In some cases, the \linkspell{Fabricate} spell can be used to achieve the results 
of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate 
Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting 
of the \linkspell{Ironwood} spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength 
of steel.

When casting the spell \linkspell{Minor Creation}, you must succeed on an appropriate 
Craft check to make a complex item.

All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised 
tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other 
hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).
\item Find the DC from the table below.
\item Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.
\item Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, 
multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC 
equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result 
x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver 
pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other 
multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x 
the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this 
week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, 
you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver 
pieces.
\end{enumerate}

If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.

If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half 
the original raw material cost again.

\textit{Progress by the Day:} You can make checks by the day instead of by the 
week. In this case your progress (check result x DC) is in copper 
pieces instead of silver pieces.

\textit{Creating Masterwork Items:} You can make a masterwork item---a weapon, 
suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional 
craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create 
the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard 
item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp 
for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component 
and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. \textit{Note:} The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, 
just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

\textit{Repairing Items:} Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against 
the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing 
an item is one-fifth of the item's price. 

When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks 
involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.

\textbf{Action:} Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see 
above).

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the 
raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

\textbf{Special:} A \linkrace{Dwarf} has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related 
to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.

A \linkrace{Gnome} has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive 
noses.

You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you 
to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by 
your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase 
the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.

To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be 
a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part 
of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult 
or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's 
lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the 
perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using 
the skill.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Appraise} 
checks related to items made with that Craft skill.
