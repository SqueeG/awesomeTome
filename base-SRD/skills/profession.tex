Like \linkskill{Craft}, \linkskill{Knowledge}, and \linkskill{Perform}, Profession is actually a number of separate 
skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each 
purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating 
or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring 
a broader range of less specific knowledge. 

\textbf{Check:} You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about 
half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You 
know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily 
tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.

\textbf{Action:} Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of 
work.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income 
cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought 
you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next 
period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

\textbf{Untrained:} Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without 
any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.
