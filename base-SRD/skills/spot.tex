\textbf{Check:} The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures 
who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the \linkskill{Hide} check of the 
creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding 
but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice 
it.

A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible 
creature near you, though you can't actually see it.

Spot is also used to detect someone in \linkskill{Disguise} (see the Disguise skill), and to 
read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.

Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. 
A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals 
or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot 
check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

\textit{Read Lips:} To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must 
be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand 
the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base 
DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must 
maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.

If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute's 
worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check fails 
by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, 
you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly 
in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.

\textbf{Action:} Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive 
manner you can make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something 
you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate 
for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can't perform any other action 
(other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously 
at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.

\textbf{Special:} A \linksec{Fascinated} creature takes a -4 penalty on Spot checks made 
as reactions.
