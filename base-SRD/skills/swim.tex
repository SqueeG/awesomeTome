\skillentry{Swim}{(Str; Armor Check Penalty)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success 
means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at 
one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no 
progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.

If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are 
swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your 
breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you 
do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard 
action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the 
duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, 
a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) 
After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round 
to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 
1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of 
nonlethal damage from fatigue.

\textbf{Action:} A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of your 
speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round action.

\textbf{Special:} Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty 
and encumbrance penalty.

If you have the \linkfeat{Athletic} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.

If you have the \linkfeat{Endurance} feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made to avoid 
taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.

A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without 
making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special 
action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, 
even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run 
action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.
