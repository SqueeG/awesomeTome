Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of 
unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an 
academic or even scientific discipline.

Below are listed typical fields of study.

\begin{itemize*}
\item Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
\item Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)
\item Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)
\item Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
\item History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
\item Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)
\item Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
\item Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)
\item Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)
\end{itemize*}

The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal 
Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)

\textbf{Check:} Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 
(for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really 
tough questions).

In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers 
or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's 
HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about 
that monster.

For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another 
piece of useful information.

\textbf{Action:} Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't 
take an action -- you simply know the answer or you don't.

\textbf{Try Again:} No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about 
a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in 
the first place.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a 
+2 bonus on \linkskill{Spellcraft} checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get 
a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Search} checks made to find secret doors or hidden compartments.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Survival} 
checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on bardic 
knowledge checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Gather Information} checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Survival} 
checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, 
marsh, mountains, or plains).

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2 bonus 
on \linkskill{Diplomacy} checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on turning 
checks against undead.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Survival} 
checks made while on other planes.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on 
\linkskill{Survival} checks made while underground.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Survival}, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) 
checks.

\textbf{Untrained:} An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. 
Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).
