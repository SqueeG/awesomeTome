\textbf{Check:} The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily 
know whether you've succeeded.

The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a 
fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher 
DCs.

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have 
failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the 
device is a trap, you spring it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you 
think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally 
for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds 
or minutes of use).

\textbf{Action:} The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends 
on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round 
action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or 
less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the \linkfeat{Nimble Fingers} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable 
Device checks.

A \linkclass{Rogue} who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how 
it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.

\textbf{Restriction:} Rogues (and other characters with the Trapfinding class feature) 
can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level 
of the magic used to create it.

The spells \linkspell{Fire Trap}, \linkspell{Glyph of Warding}, \linkspell{Symbol of Death}{Symbol} (all of them), and \linkspell{Teleportation Circle} also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device 
check. \linkspell{Spike Growth} and \linkspell{Spike Stones}, however, create magic traps 
against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions 
for details.

\subsubsection{Other Ways To Beat A Trap}

It's possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check.

\textbf{Ranged Attack Traps:} Once a trap's location is known, the obvious way 
to ruin it is to smash the mechanism -- assuming the mechanism can be accessed. 
Failing that, it's possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. 
Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage 
to break through the plugs.

\textbf{Melee Attack Traps:} These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism 
or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies 
the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid 
damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes 
off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within 
the next minute.

\textbf{Pits:} Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it 
an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is 
an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could 
neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them---they break just 
as daggers do.

\textbf{Magic Traps:} \linkspell{Dispel Magic} helps here. Someone who succeeds on 
a caster level check against the level of the trap's creator suppresses the trap 
for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted \textit{dispel magic}, not the 
area version (see the spell description).
