\textbf{Check:} The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.

\textit{Ropes:} Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. 
Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder 
gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.

\textit{Manacles and Masterwork Manacles:} The DC for manacles is set by their 
construction.

\textit{Tight Space:} The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space 
where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need 
to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not 
fit through.

\textit{Grappler:} You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's 
grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're 
only grappling).

\textbf{Action:} Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, 
or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from 
a net or an \linkspell{Animate Rope}, \linkspell{Command Plants}, \linkspell{Control Plants}, or \linkspell{Entangle} spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. 
Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending 
on how long the space is.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if 
you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the 
situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as 
you're not being actively opposed.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the \linkfeat{Agile} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist 
checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus 
on \linkskill{Use Rope} checks to bind someone.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks 
when escaping from rope bonds.
