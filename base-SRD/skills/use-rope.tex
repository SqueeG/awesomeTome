\textbf{Check:} Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various 
tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.

\begin{tabular}{c l}
\textbf{Use Rope DC} & \textbf{Task}\\
10 & Tie a firm knot\\
10\textsuperscript{1} & Secure a grappling hook\\
15 & Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug\\
15 & Tie a rope around yourself one-handed\\
15 & Splice two ropes together\\
Varies & Bind a character\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textsuperscript{1} Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textit{Secure a Grappling Hook:} Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope 
check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to 
a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails 
to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that 
the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting 
weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will 
hold your weight.

\textit{Bind a Character:} When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape 
Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.

You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to 
escape from bonds. You don't even make your Use Rope check until someone tries 
to escape.

\textbf{Action:} Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes 
an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around 
yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. 
Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.

\textbf{Special:} A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. 
If you cast an \linkspell{Animate Rope} spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance 
bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.

These bonuses stack.

If you have the \linkfeat{Deft Hands} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on 
\linkskill{Climb} checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Escape Artist} checks 
when escaping from rope bonds.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on checks made 
to bind someone.
