\skillentry{Move Silently}{(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone 
who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. 
When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you 
take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while 
running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. 
When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently 
check as indicated below.

checks.

If you have the \linkfeat{Stealthy} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks.
