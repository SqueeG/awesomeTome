%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate 
skills.

You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased 
as a separate skill.

Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, 
instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category 
below.

\begin{itemize*}
\item Act (comedy, drama, mime)
\item Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
\item Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
\item Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
\item Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
\item Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
\item String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
\item Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
\item Sing (ballad, chant, melody)
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Check:} You can impress audiences with your talent and skill.

\textbf{Perform DC} & \textbf{Performance}\\

15 & Enjoyable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.\\
20 & Great performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.\\
25 & Memorable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.\\
30 & Extraordinary performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant potential patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.\\

A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks 
that involve its use.

\textbf{Action:} Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere 
from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based 
abilities are described in that class's description.

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, 
and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced 
against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)

\textbf{Special:} A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire 
courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his \textit{fascinate }ability. 
A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his 
\textit{suggestion }ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his 
\textit{song of freedom }ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to 
use his \textit{mass suggestion }ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.

In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with \linkskill{Sleight of Hand}, \linkskill{Tumble}{Tumbling}, \linkskill{Balance}{Tightrope walking}, and spells (especially illusions).
