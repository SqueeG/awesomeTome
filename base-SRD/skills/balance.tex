%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you 
move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means 
you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty 
varies with the surface, as follows:

\textit{Being Attacked while Balancing:} You are considered flat-footed while balancing, 
since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to 
AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed 
while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance 
check against the same DC to remain standing.

\textit{Accelerated Movement:} You can try to walk across a precarious surface 
more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed 
as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, 
one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge 
across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple 
of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge.

\textbf{Action:} None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as 
part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the \linkfeat{Agile} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Tumble}, you get a +2 bonus on 
Balance checks.
