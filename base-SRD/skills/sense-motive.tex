\textbf{Check:} A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the \linkskill{Bluff} 
skill). You can also use this skill to determine when "something is up" (that 
is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness.

\textit{Hunch:} This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social 
situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, 
such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling 
that someone is trustworthy.

\textit{Sense Enchantment:} You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced 
by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even 
if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated 
(see \linkspell{Dominate Person}), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range 
of the target's activities.

\textit{Discern Secret Message:} You may use \linkskill{Sense Motive} to detect that a hidden 
message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive 
check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. 
For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you 
take a -2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you 
know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything 
specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and 
understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. 
If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.

\textbf{Action:} Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at 
least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the 
people around you.

\textbf{Try Again:} No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff 
check made against you.

\textbf{Special:} A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this 
skill against a favored enemy.

If you have the \linkfeat{Negotiator} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus 
on Diplomacy checks.
