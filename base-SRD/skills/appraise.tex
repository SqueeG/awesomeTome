\textbf{Check:} You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise 
check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50\% to 150\% (2d6+3 times 
10\%,) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, 
or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure 
means you cannot estimate the item's value.

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving 
any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives 
you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued 
by weight, including anything made of precious metals.

These bonuses stack.

\textbf{Action:} Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round 
actions).

\textbf{Try Again:} No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of 
success.

\textbf{Special:} A \linkrace{Dwarf} gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related 
to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all 
kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).

The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

A character with the \linkfeat{Diligent} feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 ranks in any \linkskill{Craft} skill, you gain a +2 bonus on 
Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.

\textbf{Untrained:} For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. 
For rare items, success means an estimate of 50\% to 150\% (2d6+3 times 10\%).
