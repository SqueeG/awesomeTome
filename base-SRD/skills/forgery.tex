\textbf{Check:} Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document 
being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what 
you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document 
on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government 
decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document 
before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an 
autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge 
a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample 
of that person's handwriting is needed.

The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery 
is. As with Disguise, you don't even need to make a check until someone examines 
the work. Your Forgery check is opposed by the Forgery check of the person who 
examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on 
his or her check if any of the conditions on the table below exist.

\begin{tabular}{l p{2.7cm}}
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Reader's Forgery Check Modifier}\\
Type of document unknown to reader & -2\\
Type of document somewhat known to reader & +0\\
Type of document well known to reader & +2\\
Handwriting not known to reader & -2\\
Handwriting somewhat known to reader & +0\\
Handwriting intimately known to reader & +2\\
Reader only casually reviews the document & -2\\

A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that 
requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase 
that character's suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the checker's 
opposing Forgery check).

\textbf{Action:} Forging a very short and simple document takes about 1 minute. 
A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per page.

\textbf{Try Again:} Usually, no. A retry is never possible after a particular reader 
detects a particular forgery. But the document created by the forger might still 
fool someone else. The result of a Forgery check for a particular document must 
be used for every instance of a different reader examining the document. No reader 
can attempt to detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed 
check goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can't try using his own skill 
again, even if he's suspicious about the document.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the \linkfeat{Deceitful} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery 
checks.

\textbf{Restriction:} Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to forge documents and 
detect forgeries, you must be able to read and write the language in question. 
A barbarian can't learn the Forgery skill unless he has learned to read and write.
