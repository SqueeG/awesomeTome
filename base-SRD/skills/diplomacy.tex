\textbf{Check:} You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with 
a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, 
for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and 
the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two 
advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.

\textbf{Action:} Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 
1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time 
requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round 
action, but you take a -10 penalty on the check.

\textbf{Try Again:} Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not 
work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be 
persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check 
fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, 
and a retry is futile.

\textbf{Special:} A \linkrace{Half-Elf} has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.

If you have the \linkfeat{Negotiator} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Bluff}, \linkskill{Knowledge} (nobility and 
royalty), or \linkskill{Sense Motive}, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.
