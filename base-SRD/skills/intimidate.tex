\textbf{Check:} You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your 
Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character 
level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves 
against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target 
as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. 
(That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer 
limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, 
above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains 
in your presence, and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. After this 
time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally 
unfriendly, to hostile).

If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless 
information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.

\textit{Demoralize Opponent:} You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's 
resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified 
level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken 
character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. 
You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that 
can see you.

\textbf{Action:} Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. 
Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.

\textbf{Try Again:} Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not 
work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated 
only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character 
has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry 
is futile.

\textbf{Special:} You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category 
that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your 
Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.

A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.

If you have the \linkfeat{Persuasive} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Bluff}, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate 
checks.
