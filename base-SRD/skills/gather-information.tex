\skillentry{Gather Information}{(Cha)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making 
friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's 
major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would 
be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a 
map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, 
or even higher.

\textbf{Action:} A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may 
draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.

\textbf{Special:} A \linkrace{Half-Elf} has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.

If you have the \linkfeat{Investigator} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (local), you get a +2 
bonus on Gather Information checks.
