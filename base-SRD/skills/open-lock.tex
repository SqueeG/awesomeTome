Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a -2 circumstance 
penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork 
thieves' tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

\textbf{Check:} The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on the 
quality of the lock, as given on the table below.

\textbf{Action:} Opening a lock is a full-round action.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on Open 
Lock checks.

\textbf{Untrained:} You cannot pick locks untrained, but you might successfully 
force them open.
