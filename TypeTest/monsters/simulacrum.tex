% BIG HONKIN' NOTE:
% This uses \subsubsection instead of \monster. This is because we put 
% The Book of Gears in its entirety in its own appendix instead of moving 
% stuff around (I did it this way because the book is unfinished and it would 
% be awfully weird and illogical to move stuff around until it is finished).
% 
% So, when we finally move stuff around and put the simulacrum in the "Monsters" 
% chapter, we're gonna want to use \monster (which creates a subsection and a label 
% for hyperlinking) instead of \subsubsection.

\subsubsection{Simulacrum}
Whether created by an Effigy Master, a mystic location or some other powerful source of illusion magic, a simulacrum is a construct made of ice and snow which appears to be a normal living creature through the power of illusion. Some

It is important to note, however, that simulacra are entirely capable of using equipment, and usually will do so. Like most constructs, a simulacrum's true power comes to the fore when gifted with some basic mundane and magical equipment. Here is a sample simulacrum which has been given a magic shield, a magic breastplate, and a Frost Sword -- all equipment which is well within the capabilities of an Effigy Master to acquire or produce. While the simulacrum is still a "CR 3 Creature" -- once it has been armed and equipped it is \textit{much} more formidable.
