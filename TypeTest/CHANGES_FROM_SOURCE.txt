I made the following changes from the source material (the Tomes), not counting 
fixed typos and formatting issues:

* All of the skill point 

* The Marshall's tower shield proficiency was changed to great shield proficiency.

* Skill feats:
  - Changed the rank 19 ability of Battlefield Surgeon to cost the same as a True Resurrection.
  - Changed the rank 4 ability of Con Artist from "bonus on Diplomacy checks" to "ranks in the Bluff skill."
  - Added "This ability can only be used once per round." to the end of the rank 4 ability of Deft Fingers.
  - Added "until they lose sight of you" to the rank 19 ability of Dreadful Demeanor (it otherwise has no duration).
  - Removed Leap of the Heavens until a better version is made.
  - Changed the save DC on the rank 14 ability of Master of Terror to 10 + 1/2 char level + cha modifier, instead of full character level.
  - Changed "1/2 your caster level" to "1/2 your character level" in the Professional Luddite skill.
  - Removed Super Scaler until a better version is made.
